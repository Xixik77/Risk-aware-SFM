# üìå Risk-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Interaction Simulation

This repository contains the code for the paper:  
**Risk-aware pedestrian-vehicle interaction simulation: A multi-objective evolutionary Bayesian-optimized social force model with adaptive interaction decisions**

---

## üìã Introduction

This repository provides the source code for simulating risk-aware pedestrian-vehicle interactions based on an improved **Social Force Model (SFM)** integrated with a **decision-making module**. The simulation parameters are optimized via a **multi-objective evolutionary Bayesian optimization framework**, targeting a balance between **trajectory accuracy (ADE)** and **interaction safety realism (RPETE)**. The approach is validated on **CITR** and **DUT** datasets.

### The repository supports:
- Simulated pedestrian-vehicle interactions under varying traffic scenarios.
- A decision module that dynamically adjusts pedestrian responses based on vehicle proximity and behavior.
- Parameter optimization based on Pareto-efficient trade-offs between competing objectives.
